# HopeBridge Introduction
HopeBridge is an AI-driven mental health assessment and recommendation system designed to evaluate depression risk and recommends personalized healthcare support . The system determines risk levels categorized as low, medium and high. The risk is calculates using four different measurements like Face Recognition which analyzes emotional states, MCQ-based Screening Tests, Chatbot Interactions, and optionally Journal Entries—both of which utilize Sentiment Analysis. Based on the final classification, HopeBridge tailors recommendations using a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) model, filtering  doctors by district and specialization for appropriate treatment according to their risk level and age 13 and below or higher. For high-risk users , the system recommends the emergency contact hotline along with the other recommendations. Additionally, HopeBridge aims to maintain a medical profile to track users’ mental health status over time, ensuring continuity of care and improved treatment outcomes.
